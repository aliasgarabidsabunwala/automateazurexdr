## Project Title
Automating Azure integration into XDR tools like SentinelOne, Sophos and Splunk.

## Problem Statement/ Opportunity
Creating an Executable script for integrating Threat Intelligence and Analysis, XDR platforms like SentinelOne, and Splunk, into Azure using Azure Blob Storage having endpoint set at GitHub to execute it as and when required by selecting options like 1. for SentinelOne, 2. For Sophos and, 3. For Splunk.

## Project Description
### The core idea of your project: solving a problem statement / working on an opportunity area?
Creating an Executable script for integrating Threat Intelligence and Analysis, XDR platforms like SentinelOne, and Splunk, into Azure using Azure Blob Storage having endpoint set at GitHub to execute it as and when required by selecting options like 1. for SentinelOne, 2. For Sophos and, 3. For Splunk.

### The problem you are trying to solve and how are you solving it?
This project is useful for people who don't have time to follow official steps for connecting SentinelOne and Splunk into Azure. So, to solve it we created this script to solve the problem around this using Azure Blob Storage functionality along with using GitHub as endpoint for it.

### Mention how your project addresses a clear need, problem, or opportunity and is the solution clearly explained?
This project is useful for people who don't have time to follow official steps for connecting SentinelOne and Splunk into Azure. So, to solve it we created this script to solve the problem around this using Azure Blob Storage functionality along with using GitHub as endpoint for it.

### Is the project’s purpose and basic functionality mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area?
Yes, the project’s purpose and basic functionality is PERFECTLY mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area.

# To create scripts in Azure using GitHub integration to integrate XDR (Extended Detection and Response) tools like SentinelOne, Sophos, and Splunk, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up a GitHub repository: Create a new repository in GitHub or use an existing one to host your scripts. This repository will be used to version control and manage your code.

2. Set up Azure Automation: Azure Automation provides a cloud-based automation and configuration service. It allows you to create, monitor, and deploy runbooks, which are a set of scripts that perform specific tasks. Set up an Azure Automation account in the Azure portal if you haven't done so already.

3. Connect Azure Automation to GitHub: In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Automation account and go to the "Source control" section. Configure the connection to your GitHub repository, allowing Azure Automation to synchronize the scripts from the repository.

4. Create a runbook: In Azure Automation, create a new runbook for each XDR tool you want to integrate. A runbook is essentially a script that contains the logic and instructions for automating tasks.

5. Write the script: Use the scripting language supported by Azure Automation (PowerShell, Python, or PowerShell Workflow) to write the script for each runbook. The exact script content will depend on the specific integration requirements of the XDR tool you are working with.

6. Integrate the XDR tool: Inside the runbook script, you'll need to incorporate the necessary code and API calls to interact with the XDR tool's API or SDK. This integration code will depend on the specific tool you are working with. Refer to the documentation provided by each XDR tool to understand the API or SDK capabilities and how to interact with it.

7. Test and debug: Test your script by running it manually or using Azure Automation's testing capabilities. Ensure that the script executes as expected and performs the desired integration tasks with the XDR tool.

8. Commit and push changes to GitHub: Once you are satisfied with the script, commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository. Azure Automation will automatically synchronize the updated scripts.

9. Schedule and automate: In Azure Automation, you can schedule the execution of runbooks based on specific time intervals or trigger them based on events. Configure the scheduling and automation settings according to your requirements.

10. Monitor and troubleshoot: Monitor the execution of your runbooks in Azure Automation to ensure they are running correctly and handling any errors or exceptions. Use the logging and monitoring features provided by Azure Automation to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

By following these steps, you can create scripts in Azure using GitHub integration to integrate XDR tools like SentinelOne, Sophos, and Splunk, automating various security-related tasks and leveraging the capabilities of these tools. Remember to refer to the documentation and resources provided by each XDR tool for detailed instructions on their integration and scripting capabilities.
