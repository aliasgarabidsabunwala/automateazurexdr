## Project Title
Automating Azure integration into XDR tools like SentinelOne, Sophos and Splunk.

## Problem Statement/ Opportunity
Creating an Executable script for integrating Threat Intelligence and Analysis, XDR platforms like SentinelOne, and Splunk, into Azure using Azure Blob Storage having endpoint set at GitHub to execute it as and when required by selecting options like - 

            - 1. for SentinelOne, 
            - 2. For Sophos, and, 
            - 3. For Splunk.

## Project Description
### The core idea of your project: solving a problem statement / working on an opportunity area?
Creating an Executable script for integrating Threat Intelligence and Analysis, XDR platforms like SentinelOne, and Splunk, into Azure using Azure Blob Storage having endpoint set at GitHub to execute it as and when required by selecting options like -

            - 1. for SentinelOne, 
            - 2. For Sophos, and, 
            - 3. For Splunk.

### The problem you are trying to solve and how are you solving it?
This project is useful for people who don't have time to follow official steps for connecting SentinelOne and Splunk into Azure. So, to solve it we created this script to solve the problem around this using Azure Blob Storage functionality along with using GitHub as endpoint for it.

### Mention how your project addresses a clear need, problem, or opportunity and is the solution clearly explained?
This project is useful for people who don't have time to follow official steps for connecting SentinelOne and Splunk into Azure. So, to solve it we created this script to solve the problem around this using Azure Blob Storage functionality along with using GitHub as endpoint for it.

### Is the project’s purpose and basic functionality mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area?
Yes, the project’s purpose and basic functionality is PERFECTLY mapped to the problem statement/opportunity area.

# To create scripts in Azure using GitHub integration to integrate XDR (Extended Detection and Response) tools like SentinelOne, Sophos, and Splunk, you can follow these general steps:

1. Set up an Azure environment:
   - Create an Azure subscription if you don't have one already.
   - Set up an Azure resource group to organize your resources.

   - Provision the necessary Azure services like Azure Functions for executing our scripts.

2. Set up a GitHub repository:
   - Create a GitHub repository to host your scripts.
   - Initialize the repository with a README file and any other necessary files.

3. Create your integration scripts:
   - Determine the specific actions you want to perform with each XDR tool (SentinelOne, Sophos, Splunk) and the corresponding APIs or SDKs provided by each tool.
   - Choose a scripting language like PowerShell Core to write our scripts.
   - Use the relevant APIs or SDKs to interact with the XDR tools and perform the desired actions.

4. Store your scripts in the GitHub repository:
   - Commit and push your scripts to the GitHub repository.
   - Ensure your scripts are well-documented, including any dependencies and required configurations.

5. Set up Azure Automation:
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to Azure Automation.
   - Create an Azure Automation account if you haven't done so already.
   - Inside the Automation account, create an Azure Automation Runbook.
   - Link the Runbook to your GitHub repository using the GitHub integration in Azure Automation. This integration allows you to automatically pull script changes from the repository.

6. Configure triggers and schedules:
   - Determine the triggers or schedules for executing your scripts. For example, you might want to trigger a script when a new event occurs in one of the XDR tools or run it periodically.
   - Set up the appropriate triggers or schedules in Azure Automation based on your requirements.

7. Test and monitor:
   - Test your scripts by executing them manually or by triggering the associated events.
   - Monitor the execution logs and any outputs or errors generated by the scripts.
   - Iterate and refine your scripts as needed based on the results and feedback.

By following these steps, you can create and manage scripts in Azure using GitHub integration to integrate XDR tools like SentinelOne, Sophos, and Splunk. Remember to consult the documentation and APIs provided by each XDR tool to understand the specific integration capabilities and features available.
