## Project Description
Creating an Executable script for integrating Threat Intelligence and Analysis, XDR platforms like SentinelOne, and Splunk, into Azure using Azure Blob Storage having endpoint set at GitHub to execute it as and when required by selecting options like 1. for SentinelOne and 2. For Splunk.

This project is useful for people who don't have time to follow official steps for connecting SentinelOne and Splunk into Azure. So, to solve it we created this script to solve the problem around this using Azure Blob Storage functionality along with using GitHub as endpoint for it.
